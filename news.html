<!-- Story that talks about the origins of the team -->
<h2>DD FC Origins</h2>

<p>
    DD FC was founded in the fall of 2021 just before the outdoor season of that semester. In the very
    beginning, the roster only held three founding members. As time went on, Mark Myers recruited a few
    girls to play which brought the roster total up to six people. (9 players play on the field at a time)
    However, these girls did not play soccer and were unsure about wanting to play at all. With only one
    week until the first game of the season, things were not looking good for DD FC.
</p>

<br>

<p>
    Mark decided to sit down and have a conversation with the other two founding members. There was a serious
    discussion of terminating the team before it started. In fact, the boys were leaning that way and were
    practically set on that decision. It was when they went to inform the other girls on the roster when 
    everything changed. The girls were very opinionated on the fact that they would not let that happen. 
    They went to Facebook to put out an add for girls to join the team. In an instant, DD FC became the most
    popular team in the league. There was request after request to join even to the point where Mark had to
    make cuts and deny some of them. 
</p>

<br>

<p>
    Eventually, Mark got a completed roster put together and DD FC was born. In their first season, DD FC
    went undefeated in the regular season before going out in the second round of the playoffs. Today, 
    the roster remains mostly unchanged after five seasons together.

    <!-- Story about the team's most recent game and what happened during it -->
<h2>
    Injury Setback
</h2>

<p>
    In DD FC's most recent playoff game, there was some serious adversity to be faced caused by an injury.
    The first half went well, as DD FC had scored twice making the score 2-0 at half time. When the second
    half started, the opponents scored a controvertial goal after a referee decision making the score 2-1. 
    DD FC were still in control at this point until disaster struck.
</p>

<br>

<p>
    Just after the opponents scored their goal, Olivia Collar was going for the ball with her usual intensity.
    She was challenged by a defender and immediately went down in extreme pain. Her leg had been hurt badly
    to the point where she needed medical attention. The game was delayed and the DD FC team was very upset
    by their teammates injury. Olivia urged the team to go on without her as she could not continue to play.
    DD FC went back out there, but the emotional turmoil proved to be too much for the team as they made
    mistake after mistake. The opposition scored three unanswered goals to make the final score 2-4. 
</p>

<br>

<p>
    Olivia is in good spirits now and hopes to be back for the next season with DD FC.
