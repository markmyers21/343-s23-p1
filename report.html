    This is my itemized breakdown of how I completed each of the requirements.

    <br>

    1. I have 5 separate pages that link to each other. The home page is called index.html.

    <br>

    2. I have declared a favicon for each page and it is the same for each. Note: The favicon is the only image I got from the internet, but it was from a public domain.

    <br>

    3. I have declared a header on each page.

    <br>

    4. I have navigation links on each page linking to each other.

    <br>

    5. I used media queries in some of my .css files. I used them to shrink the images when they were present and keep the text from bleeding into the nav.

    <br>

    6. I have multiple images throughout my pages and they each have alt attributes that describe the picture.

    <br>

    7. All of my pages evaluate without errors except for one. The only error I have is due to an empty button in the form, but the specs say that is okay to have an empty form so I left it.

    <br>

    8. I used 2 different font faces, sans-serif for the headers and serif for paragraphs.

    <br>

    9. I have a form on the home page that takes a name and promises more information about the team.

    <br>

    10. I have included a link to an external cite which is the UREC intramural registration page.

    <br>

    11. My cite is available at <a href = "https://markmyers21.github.io/343-s23-p1"> Link</a>.

    <br>

    12. My pdf design sketch is available at <a href = "https://markmyers21.github.io/343-s23-p1/design/343%20Sketch%20PDF.pdf">Link</a>.
